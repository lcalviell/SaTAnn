# Introduction

SaTAnn is an R package that detects and quantifies ORF translation using Ribo-seq [1] data. This package uses syntax and functions present in *Bioconductor* packages like *GenomicFeatures*, *rtracklayer* or *BSgenome*.
This vignette illustrates the usage of the package using example data and annotation.

**Warning**: While we encourage users to get familiar with each outlined step, executing all the code on your machine will generate a lot of data (~310 Mb) and it might take some time (~10 minutes). Please make sure to have enough disk space if you decide to execute code from all the sections.

As a first step, let's load the package:

```{r load_lib}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("SaTAnn"))
```


# Exploring the annotation

As in the *Ribo-seQC* package [2] (https://github.com/lcalviell/Ribo-seQC), we use a .gtf file and a .2bit file to create a comprehensive list of annotated transcript and genomic features. Let's now download annotation for *Homo sapiens*: a subset of the GENCODE 25 annotation (https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_25.html) and the corresponding genome sequences.

```{r create_dirs_hum}
download.file("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1n6UA5cSz6djx0dY_7sI57177T-kyZhhT",destfile = "test_human.2bit")
download.file("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=19Am9-iMEyB-AcIsVRdIqrF-BVdQYrcaI",destfile = "test_human.gtf")
```


To parse the rich information present in our *.gtf* file we use the *prepare_annotation_files* function. Such a function creates a *TxDb*  and a compressed *Rdata* file containing several regions of interest and additional information.
Moreover, such function reads a genome file in *.2bit* to forge a *BSgenome* package for fast and efficient query of genomic sequences. A *.2bit* file can be obtained from a *.fasta* file using the *faToTwoBit* software from UCSC: https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/twoBit.html - http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/ )




```{r create_annot_hum}
prepare_annotation_files(annotation_directory = ".",
                         twobit_file = "test_human.2bit",
                         gtf_file = "test_human.gtf",scientific_name = "Human.test",
                         annotation_name = "genc25_22M",export_bed_tables_TxDb = F,forge_BSgenome = T,create_TxDb = T)
```


We can now read such information using the *load_annotation* function:

```{r load_hum}
load_annotation("test_human.gtf_Rannot")
```

Two objects have now been created: a *genome_seq* object links to the *BSgenome* package we just created and loaded (containing genome sequences), and a *GTF_annotation* object containing important information present in our *.gtf* file.
For instance, we can access genomic sequences using commands as:

```{r gen_hum}
genome_seq[["chr22"]]
genome_seq[["chrM"]]
```

Transcript annotation and CDS annotations can be accessed as follows:

```{r gtf_hum_general_1}
GTF_annotation$exons_txs
```

```{r gtf_hum_general_2}
GTF_annotation$cds_txs
```


The genomic sequences corresponding to such genomic regions can be easily extracted:

```{r gen_hum_cds}
getSeq(genome_seq,GTF_annotation$cds_txs[[4]])
```

A list of annotated start and stop codons, including the transcripts they map to, can be accessed using:

```{r gtf_hum_general_3}
GTF_annotation$start_stop_codons
```

CDS annotation in transcript-level coordinates is also reported:

```{r gtf_hum_general_4}
GTF_annotation$cds_txs_coords
```

A list of gene ids, transcript ids, together with their symbols and biotypes, can be accessed with:

```{r gtf_hum_general_5}
GTF_annotation$trann
```

The genetic codes used for each chromosomes are accessed using:

```{r gtf_hum_general_6}
GTF_annotation$genetic_codes
getGeneticCode(GTF_annotation$genetic_codes["chr22","genetic_code"])
getGeneticCode(GTF_annotation$genetic_codes["chrM","genetic_code"])
```

Annotation and genome sequences are linked together in the annotation creation step.
The BSgenome package corresponding to the .gtf file used is reported in the *GTF_annotation* object:

```{r gtf_hum_general_7}
GTF_annotation$genome_package
```


# Prepare input files (human)

Let's now download a subset of a Ribo-seq dataset in HEK293 cells [3].


```{r prepare_1}
download.file("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1lpoFNMgSUvthfQBnBZNjWWNglinAIHLj",destfile = "test_human_hek.bam")
```

There are two ways to prepare the input file for *SaTAnn*: the recommended one is to use *Ribo-seQC* [2], which automatically output a "*for_SaTAnn" file together with many other statistics about the alignment.

As an alternative, we can use the *prepare_for_SaTAnn* function, supplied with the bam file together with a text file specifying read lengths and cutoffs to use (as well as information about their possible organelle of origin [2]):

```{r prepare2}
download.file("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1cszfwJKiTeQMK-G4_R5KOt8rWoFrV-R_",destfile ="instructions_hektest.txt")
prepare_for_SaTAnn(annotation_file = "test_human.gtf_Rannot",bam_file = "test_human_hek.bam",path_to_rl_cutoff_file = "instructions_hektest.txt")
```

Additionally, users can input their custom P_sites tracks using other options in the *prepare_for_SaTAnn* function.

# Run SaTAnn

We can now run *SaTAnn* using the annotation and the *for_SaTAnn* file we created.
*SaTAnn* can be run on a specific list of genes, or (**recommended!**) on the entire set of possible transcripts. We strongly recommend running *SaTAnn* on the entire transcriptome, to check the general validity of its results (see next section). We recommend using an HPC cluster. On average, using 7 cores with 10G of RAM per core will take ~12 hours to run the pipeline on the entire transcriptome.

An example run on 2 genes is:

```{r run_1}
run_SaTAnn(for_SaTAnn_file = "test_human_hek.bam_for_SaTAnn",
           annotation_file = "test_human.gtf_Rannot",n_cores = 1,gene_name =c("MIEF1","ARSA"))
```

This will produce different files, such as annotation in .gtf format for the *de-novo* identified ORFs and selected transcript structures, or protein sequences in .fasta format.
For a more detailed list of output files, please check:

```{r run_help1}
?run_SaTAnn
```

Additionally, an object called *SaTAnn_results* (corresponding to the *final_SaTAnn_results* file, use the *load* function to import it) should be now available in your environment:

```{r run_2}
names(SaTAnn_results)
```

Such an object is a *list* containing comprehensive statistics on the set of identified ORFs.
For example:

```{r run_3}
SaTAnn_results$ORFs_tx
```

will show transcript positions and and other statistics about the quantification of translation on each of the identified ORFs, while: 

```{r run_5}
SaTAnn_results$ORFs_gen
```
will show genomic regions corresponding to the identified ORFs.


The list of selected transcripts can be accessed using:
```{r run_6}
SaTAnn_results$selected_txs
```

A more detailed list of all the output objects and content is available running:

```{r run_help2}
?SaTAnn
?run_SaTAnn
```


# Create a summary html report

Summary plots can be obtained from the full (run on the entire transcriptome) *SaTAnn* output.
Let's download full annotation, the *SaTAnn* output and the for_SaTAnn object for the entire HEK293 dataset [3].

```{r summary1}
download.file("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1BTIWhNMC_d_iGciobjbwqrjJV5x2JzAp",destfile = "HEK293_final_SaTAnn_results")
download.file("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1xKV_oQbC_8FIK9vepldZtiBXzofI56zi",destfile = "HEK293_for_SaTAnn")
download.file("https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1aLMvP7IeBDz-CH8Ifm6daLw1aFopyUjB",destfile = "full_genc25_Rannot")
```

We can create summary plots (showing number of detected ORFs for different gene biotypes, statistics on ORF quantifications etc..) in *.pdf* format using:

```{r summary2}
plot_SaTAnn_results(for_SaTAnn_file = "HEK293_for_SaTAnn",SaTAnn_output_file = "HEK293_final_SaTAnn_results",annotation_file = "full_genc25_Rannot")
```

An *RData* object (*_SaTAnn_plots_RData*) containing all the information to reproduce the plots is also created.
Additionally, the plots can be embedded in a html report (with the possibility of including results from different *SaTAnn* runs) using:

```{r summary3}
create_SaTAnn_html_report(input_files = "HEK293_final_SaTAnn_results_plots/HEK293_SaTAnn_plots_RData",input_sample_names = "HEK2932_riboseq", output_file= "HEK293_SaTAnn_report.html")
```

The html report can be opened by different browsers such as Firefox or Chrome.
